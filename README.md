selfie
========

A selfie is a useful indicator of identity.

A selfie is a public-key that has been signed
by its own private key, together with a timestamp
generated at the point of signing.

If someone presents you with a selfie,
you can validate that the public key was signed
at the time given by someone in posession
of the private key.
